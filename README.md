###Advent of Code 2018
___
Happy Holidays! The purpose of this repository is to hold all the source code for my own solutions to the Advent of Code challenge in 2018. All my solutions will be written in Python.

## Why Python?
___
I find Python the fastest for me to write small coding challenges for. It's mainly personal preference. Python also has some built in data-structures that I find particularly useful and easy to use, which can be utilized in certain situations to optimize run time.

## Additional Notes
___
The code you see on this repository has been cleaned up a little bit. When I first write the code, it tends to be very sloppy just so I can complete the challenge as quickly as possible. It may not be particularly time or memory efficient upon submission. However, I do try to make it a bit more readable and optimized before pushing it to this repository, but no promises :)

## Get Involved!
___
Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that starts at midnight EST on the first of December. 25 Days, 25 coding challenges. Check it out [here](https://adventofcode.com)!
